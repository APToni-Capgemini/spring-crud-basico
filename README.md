We love smart developers, and the way for achieving that is a code showroom where the developer may discuss its code with our senior developers. 
Please do this exercise without anybody´s help.

What we expect from you:

- We expect to have a README.md that explains how to compile and run this code.
- We expect you to produce the best code you can provide to us, and that you can explain the choices you made.
- We expect an API Rest solution using Spring Framework v5.3.x.

Also:

- Use the tools you think will help you with the tasks
- It’s not about doing the perfect, best ultimate code. Do what you think is the minimum professional software deliverable
- Do not worry about Devops and Infrastructure as a code, we want to see how you code.
 
If anything is not clear to get started or you have any questions, feel free to ask us.
